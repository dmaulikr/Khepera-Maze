Guiding a Khepera Robot through a maze
================

The task is to get a Khepera robot through a maze.

- `main.m` contains the script to actually achieve this goal.
- `object_recognition/updaterobot.m` is used to do visual processing and localize objects of interest.
- `movement/visualturn.m` implements a simple feedback control of the robots movement. See images/robot-control-diagram for more info.
- `vendor` provides scripts provided as example code. Almost none of this is actually used.
